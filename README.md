# Pipeline Examples

This repository contains example code for a series of tutorials for Acquia Pipelines.  Each tutorial is in its own branch.  Each branch contains the sample code for that tutorial, plus a README that includes:

* additional information and/or specific instructions,
* a link to a ZIP file containing all the same code, for easy access, and
* a link to a video that explains the tutorial and shows how it works.

The examples are:

* **[example101](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines101)** - "Hello, World"; the simplest possible Pipelines job, just to get started.
* **[example201](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines201)** - Build a Drupal site using the Acquia Lightning distribution using Composer.
* **[example301](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines301)** - Access a private respository using Composer by safely adding an SSH key to your Pipelines YAML file.
* **[example401](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines401)** - Safely store secret data such as credentials in your Pipelines YAML file to be accessible to your job via an environment variable.
* **[example501](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines501)** - Start a web and MySQL server, and run Behat tests against your site, all within your Pipelines job.
* **[example601](https://github.com/acquia/pipelines-examples/tree/pipelines601)** - Install node version manner and node package manager
